Sharing the [[Southern Cone]] with its smaller neighbour [[Chile]], it is bordered by [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] to the north; [[Brazil]] to the northeast; [[Uruguay]] and the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] to the east; Chile to the west and the [[Drake Passage]] to the south.

With a mainland area of {{convert|2780400|km2|mi2|abbr=on}},{{efn-ua|name=excl_area}} Argentina is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|eighth-largest country]] in the world, the second-largest in [[Latin America]], and the largest [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking]] one.
Argentina claims sovereignty over [[Argentine Antarctica|part of Antarctica]], the [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|Falkland Islands]] ({{lang-es|link=no|Islas Malvinas}}), [[South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands sovereignty dispute|South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].

The earliest recorded human presence in the area modern-day Argentina dates back to the [[Paleolithic]] period.{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|p=17}} The country has its roots in [[Spanish empire|Spanish]] colonization of the region beginning in 1512.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=128}} Argentina rose as the successor state of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]],{{sfnm|1a1=Levene|1y=1948|1p=11|1ps=: "[After the Viceroyalty became] a new period that commenced with the revolution of 1810, whose plan consisted in declaring the independence of a nation, thus turning the legal bond of vassalage into one of citizenship as a component of sovereignty and,in addition, organizing the democratic republic."|2a1=Sánchez Viamonte|2y=1948|2pp=196–197|2ps=: "The Argentine nation was a unity in colonial times, during the Viceroyalty, and remained so after the revolution of May 1810.

The [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declaration]] and [[Argentine War of Independence|fight for independence]] (1810–1818) was followed by an [[Argentine Civil Wars|extended civil war]] that lasted until 1861, which culminated in the country's reorganization as a [[federation]] of [[Provinces of Argentina|provinces]] with [[Buenos Aires]] as its capital city. From then on—while [[Immigration in Argentina|massive waves of European immigration]] radically reshaped its cultural and demographic outlook—Argentina enjoyed an historically almost-unparalleled increase in prosperity: by the early 20th century it had already ranked as the seventh wealthiest{{sfn|Bolt|Van Zanden|2013}} developed nation{{sfn|Díaz Alejandro|1970|p=1}} in the world.

==Name and etymology==
The name "Argentina" is derived from [[Latin]] ''argentum'' ("silver", ''plata'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), a noun associated with the [[Sierra de la Plata|silver mountains legend]], widespread among the first European explorers of the [[La Plata Basin]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rock|1y=1987|1pp=6, 8|2a1=Edwards|2y=2008|2p=7}}

The first written use of the name can be traced to ''[[La Argentina (poem)|La Argentina]]'',{{efn-ua|The poem's full name is ''La Argentina y conquista del Río de la Plata, con otros acaecimientos de los reinos del Perú, Tucumán y estado del Brasil''.}} a 1602 poem by [[Martín del Barco Centenera]] describing the region and the foundation of Buenos Aires.{{sfn|Traba|1985|pp=15, 71}}
Although "Argentina" was already in common usage by the 18th century, the country was formally named "Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata" by the Spanish Empire, and "United Provinces of the Río de la Plata" after independence.

The [[Argentine Constitution of 1826|1826 constitution]] included the first use of the name "Argentine Republic" in legal documents.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=1826, art. 1}}
The name "Argentine Confederation" was also commonly used and was formalized in the [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=1853, Preamble}}
In 1860 a presidential decree settled the country's name as "Argentine Republic",{{sfn|Rosenblat|1964|p=78}} and that year's constitutional amendment ruled all the names since 1810 as legally valid.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=1860 amd., art. 35}}{{efn-ua|Also stated in article 35 of all subsequent amendments: 1866, 1898, 1949, 1957, 1972 and 1994 (current)}}

In the [[English language]] the country was traditionally called "the Argentine", mimicking the typical Spanish usage ''la Argentina''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Argentina|title=Definition of Argentina in Oxford Dictionaries (British & World English)|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|place=Oxford, UK|date=6 May 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140305011413/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Argentina|archivedate=5 March 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref> This fell out of fashion during the mid-to-late 20th century, and now the country is simply referred to as "Argentina".

In the [[Spanish language]] "Argentina" is [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] ("''La [República] Argentina''"), taking the feminine [[article (grammar)|article]] "La" as the initial syllable of "Argentina" is [[Stress (linguistics)|unstressed]].<ref>[http://www.studyspanish.com/lessons/defart2.htm "The Definite Article: Part II"], Study Spanish</ref>

===Pre-Columbian era===

[[File:SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Cueva de las Manos|Cave of the Hands]] in [[Santa Cruz province, Argentina|Santa Cruz province]], with indigenous artwork dating from 13,000–9,000 years ago|alt=Stencilled hands on the cave's wall]]
The earliest traces of human life in the area now known as Argentina are dated from the [[Paleolithic]] period, with further traces in the [[Mesolithic]] and [[Neolithic]].{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|p=17}}
Until the period of European colonization, Argentina was relatively sparsely populated by a wide number of diverse cultures with different social organizations,{{sfn|Edwards|2008|p=12}} which can be divided into three main groups:{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|pp=18–19}}
*Basic hunters and food gatherers without development of [[pottery]], like the [[Selknam]] and [[Yaghan]] in the extreme south.
*Advanced hunters and food gatherers like the [[Puelche]], [[Querandí]] and Serranos in the center-east; and the [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]] in the south—all of them conquered by the [[Mapuche]] spreading from [[Chile]]{{sfn|Edwards|2008|p=13}}—and the [[Kom people (South America)|Kom]] and [[Wichi]] in the north.
*Farmers with pottery, like the [[Charrúa]], [[Minuane]] and [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] in the northeast, with [[slash and burn agriculture|slash and burn]] semisedentary existence;{{sfn|Edwards|2008|p=12}} the advanced [[Diaguita]] sedentary [[trade|trading culture]] in the northwest, which was conquered by the [[Inca Empire]] around 1480; the [[Toconoté]] and [[Comechingones|Hênîa and Kâmîare]] in the country's center, and the [[Huarpe]] in the center-west, a culture that raised [[llama]] cattle and was strongly influenced by the Incas.{{sfn|Edwards|2008|p=12}}

===Colonial era===
{{main|Colonial Argentina}}
{{see also|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}
[[File:La Reconquista de Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The surrender of Beresford to [[Santiago de Liniers]] during the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata]]]]
Europeans first arrived in the region with the 1502 voyage of [[Amerigo Vespucci (explorer)|Amerigo Vespucci]]. The Spanish navigators [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] and [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] visited the territory that is now Argentina in 1516 and 1526, respectively.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=128}} In 1536 [[Pedro de Mendoza]] founded the small settlement of [[Buenos Aires]], which was abandoned in 1541.{{sfn|Crow|1992|pp=129–132}}

Further colonization efforts came from [[Paraguay]]—establishing the [[Governorate of the Río de la Plata]]—[[Peru]] and Chile.{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|pp=96–140}}
[[Francisco de Aguirre (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguirre]] founded [[Santiago del Estero]] in 1553. [[Londres, Catamarca|Londres]] was founded in 1558; [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], in 1561; [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], in 1562; [[San Miguel de Tucumán]], in 1565.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=353}} [[Juan de Garay]] founded [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] in 1573 and the same year [[Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera]] set up [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=134}} Garay went further south to re-fund Buenos Aires in 1580.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=135}} [[San Luis, Argentina|San Luis]] was established in 1596.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=353}}

The [[Spanish Empire]] subordinated the economic potential of the Argentine territory to the immediate wealth of the silver and gold mines in [[Bolivia]] and Peru, and as such it became part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] until the creation of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] in 1776 with Buenos Aires as its capital.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=347}}

Buenos Aires repelled [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata|two ill-fated British invasions]] in 1806 and 1807.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=421}} The ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the example of the first [[Atlantic Revolutions]] generated criticism of the [[absolutist monarchy]] that ruled the country. As in the rest of Spanish America, the overthrow of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] during the [[Peninsular War]] created great concern.{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|pp=194ff}}

===Independence and civil wars===
{{main|Argentine War of Independence|Argentine Civil Wars}}
[[File:Smartin.JPG|thumb|200px|Portrait of General [[José de San Martin]], ''[[Libertadores|Libertador]]'' of Argentina, [[Chile]] and [[Peru]]|alt=Painting of San Martín holding the Argentine flag]]
Beginning a process from which Argentina was to emerge as successor state to the Viceroyalty,{{sfnm|1a1=Levene|1y=1948|1p=11|2a1=Sánchez Viamonte|2y=1948|2pp=196–197|3a1=Vanossi|3y=1964|3p=11}} the 1810 [[May Revolution]] replaced the viceroy [[Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros]] with the [[Primera Junta|First Junta]], a new government in Buenos Aires composed by locals.{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|pp=194ff}}
In the first clashes of the Independence War the Junta crushed a royalist [[Liniers Counter-revolution|counter-revolution in Córdoba]],{{sfn|Rock|1987|p=81}} but failed to overcome those of the [[Banda Oriental]], [[First Upper Peru campaign|Upper Peru]] and [[Paraguay campaign|Paraguay]], which later became independent states.{{sfn|Rock|1987|pp=82–83}}

Revolutionaries split into two antagonist groups: the [[Unitarian Party|Centralists]] and the [[Federales (Argentina)|Federalists]]—a move that would define Argentina's first decades of independence.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=39–40}} The [[Assembly of the Year XIII]] appointed [[Gervasio Antonio de Posadas]] as Argentina's first [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata|Supreme Director]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=39–40}}

In 1816 the [[Congress of Tucumán]] formalized the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rock|1y=1987|1p=92|2a1=Lewis|2y=2003|2p=41}} One year later General [[Martín Miguel de Güemes]] stopped royalists on the north, and General [[José de San Martín]] took an army [[Crossing of the Andes|across the Andes]] and secured the [[independence of Chile]]; then he led the fight to the Spanish stronghold of [[Lima]] and proclaimed the [[independence of Peru]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

I|pp=185–252}}}} In 1819 Buenos Aires enacted a [[Argentine Constitution of 1819|centralist constitution]] that was soon [[repeal|abrogated]] by federalists.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=41}}

The 1820 [[Battle of Cepeda (1820)|Battle of Cepeda]], fought between the Centralists and the Federalists, resulted in the ''end of the Supreme Director rule''. In 1826 Buenos Aires enacted another [[Argentine Constitution of 1826|centralist constitution]], with [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] being appointed as the first president of the country. However, the interior provinces soon rose against him, forced his resignation and discarded the constitution.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=43}} Centralists and Federalists resumed the civil war; the latter prevailed and formed the [[Argentine Confederation]] in 1831, led by [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=45}} During his regime he faced a [[French blockade to the Río de la Plata|French blockade]] (1838–1840), the [[War of the Confederation]] (1836–1839), and a combined [[Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata|Anglo-French blockade]] (1845–1850), but remained undefeated and prevented further loss of national territory.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=46–47}} His trade restriction policies, however, angered the interior provinces and in 1852 [[Justo José de Urquiza]], another powerful caudillo, [[Battle of Caseros|beat him out of power]].

Overpowering Urquiza in the 1861 [[Battle of Pavón]], [[Bartolomé Mitre]] secured Buenos Aires predominance and was elected as the first president of the reunified country. He was followed by [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] and [[Nicolás Avellaneda]]; these three presidencies set up the bases of the modern Argentine State.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. I|pp=363–541}}

Starting with [[Julio Argentino Roca]] in 1880, ten consecutive federal governments emphasized [[economic liberalism|liberal economic policies]]. The [[Immigration in Argentina|massive wave of European immigration]] they promoted—second only to the United States'—led to a near-reinvention of Argentine society and economy that by 1908 had placed the country as the seventh wealthiest{{sfn|Bolt|Van Zanden|2013}} developed nation{{sfn|Díaz Alejandro|1970|p=1}} in the world.
Driven by this [[immigration]] wave and decreasing mortality, the Argentine population grew fivefold and the economy 15-fold:{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=18–30}} from 1870 to 1910 Argentina's [[wheat]] exports went from {{convert|100000|to|2500000|MT|ST|abbr=on}} per year, while frozen beef exports increased from {{convert|25000|to|365000|MT|ST|abbr=on}} per year,{{sfn|Mosk|1990|pp=88–89}} placing Argentina as one of the world's top five exporters.{{sfn|Cruz|1990|p=10}} Its railway mileage rose from {{convert|503|to|31104|km|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Díaz Alejandro|1970|pp=2–3}} Fostered by a new [[Argentine Law 1420|public, compulsory, free and secular education]] system, [[literacy]] skyrocketed from 22% to 65%, a level higher than most [[Latin America]]n nations would reach even fifty years later.{{sfn|Cruz|1990|p=10}} Furthermore, real [[GDP]] grew so fast that despite the huge immigration influx, [[per capita income]] between 1862 to 1920 went from 67% of developed country levels to 100%:{{sfn|Díaz Alejandro|1970|pp=2–3}}
*By 1865 Argentina was already one of the top 25 nations by per capita income.
*By 1901 it had risen to 10th place—ahead of Germany, Austria and France.
*By 1908 it had surpassed Denmark, Canada and The Netherlands to reach 7th place—behind Switzerland, New Zealand, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Belgium. Argentina's per capita income was 70% higher than Italy's, 90% higher than Spain's, 180% higher than Japan's and 400% higher than [[Brazil]]'s.{{sfn|Bolt|Van Zanden|2013}}
Despite these unique achievements, the country was slow to meet its original goals of industrialization:{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. I|pp=567–625}} after steep development of capital-intensive local industries in the 1920s, a significant part of the manufacture sector remained labor-intensive in the 1930s.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=37–38}}

In 1912, President [[Roque Sáenz Peña]] enacted [[Saenz Peña Law|universal and secret male suffrage]], which allowed [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]], leader of the [[Radical Civic Union]] (or UCR), to win [[Argentine general election, 1916|the 1916 election]]. He enacted social and economic reforms and extended assistance to family farmers and small businesses. Argentina stayed neutral during [[World War I]]. The second administration of Yrigoyen faced an economic crisis, influenced by the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=7–178}}

===Infamous Decade===
{{main|Infamous Decade}}
[[File:El General Roca ante el Congreso Nacional.jpg|thumb|200px|President [[Julio Argentino Roca]] giving his constitutionally mandated annual report to Congress, 1886|alt=]]
In 1930, Yrigoyen [[1930 Argentine coup d'état|was ousted from power]] by the military led by [[José Félix Uriburu]]. Although Argentina remained among the fifteen richest countries until mid-century,{{sfn|Bolt|Van Zanden|2013}} this [[coup d'état]] marks the start of the steady economic and social decline that pushed the country back<ref name=developed/> into underdevelopment.

Uriburu ruled for two years; then [[Agustín Pedro Justo]] was elected with fraud,{{clarify|date=October 2014}} and signed a controversial [[Roca-Runciman Treaty|treaty with the United Kingdom]]. Argentina [[Argentina in World War II|stayed neutral during World War II]], a decision that had full British support but was rejected by the [[United States]] after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. A new [[Revolution of '43|military coup toppled the government]], and Argentina declared war on the Axis Powers a month before the [[end of World War II in Europe]]. The minister of welfare, [[Juan Domingo Perón]], was fired and jailed because of his high popularity among workers. His liberation was forced by a [[Loyalty Day (Argentina)|massive popular demonstration]], and he went on to win the [[Argentine general election, 1946|1946 election]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=181–302}}

===Peronism===
{{main|Peronism}}
[[File:Museo del Bicentenario - "Retrato de Juan Domingo Perón y Eva Duarte", Numa Ayrinhac.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Official presidential portrait of [[Juan Domingo Perón]] and his wife [[Eva Perón]], 1948|alt=]]
Perón created a political movement known as Peronism. He [[nationalization|nationalized]] strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full [[external debt]] and achieved nearly [[full employment]]. The economy, however, began to decline in 1950 because of over-expenditure. His highly popular wife, [[Eva Perón]], played a central political role. She pushed Congress to enact [[women suffrage]] in 1947,{{sfn|Barnes|1978|p=3}} and developed an unprecedented social assistance to the most vulnerable sectors of society.{{sfn|Barnes|1978|pp=113ff}} However, her declining health did not allow her to run for the vice-presidency in 1951, and she died of cancer the following year. Perón [[Argentine general election, 1951|was reelected in 1951]], even surpassing his 1946 performance. In 1955 the Navy [[bombing of Plaza de Mayo|bombed the Plaza de Mayo]] in an ill-fated attempt to kill the President. A few months later, during the self-called [[Revolución Libertadora|Liberating Revolution]] coup, he resigned and went into [[exile]] in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=303–351}}

The new head of State, [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu]], [[proscription|proscribed]] Peronism and banned all of its manifestations; nevertheless, Peronists kept organized underground. [[Arturo Frondizi]] from the UCR won the [[Argentine general election, 1958|following elections]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=353–379}} He encouraged investment to achieve energetic and industrial self-sufficiency, reversed a chronic [[trade deficit]] and lifted Peronism proscription; yet his efforts to stay in good terms with Peronists and the military earned him the rejection of both and a new coup forced him out.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=34}} But Senate Chief [[José María Guido]] reacted swiftly and applied the anti-[[power vacuum]] legislation, becoming president instead; elections were repealed and Peronism proscribed again. [[Arturo Illia]] was [[Argentine general election, 1963|elected in 1963]] and led to an overall increase in prosperity; however his attempts to legalize Peronism resulted in his overthrow in 1966 by the [[Juan Carlos Onganía]]-led coup d'état called the [[Argentine Revolution]], a new military government that sought to rule indefinitely.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=381–422}}

===Dirty War===
{{main|Dirty War}}
The 'Dirty War ({{lang-es|Guerra Sucia|links=no}}) was the name used by the Argentine Government for a period of [[state terrorism]] in Argentina against political dissidents, with military and security forces conducting urban and rural guerrilla violence against left-wing guerrillas, political dissidents, and anyone believed to be associated with socialism.<ref>''Political Violence and Trauma in Argentina,'' Antonius C.

Declassified documents of the Chilean secret police cite an official estimate by the [[Batallón de Inteligencia 601]] of 22,000 killed or "disappeared" between 1975 and mid-1978. During this period, in which it was later revealed 8,625 "disappeared" in the form of PEN (''Poder Ejecutivo Nacional'', anglicized as "National Executive Power") detainees who were held in clandestine detention camps throughout Argentina before eventually being freed under diplomatic pressure.<ref>''Political Injustice: Authoritarianism and the Rule of Law in Brazil, Chile, and Argentina,'' Anthony W.

After democratic government was restored, Congress passed legislation to provide compensation to victims' families. Some 11,000 Argentines have applied to the relevant authorities and received up to US $200,000 each as monetary compensation for the loss of loved ones during the military dictatorship.<ref name="Wright, Thomas C. p. 158">Wright, Thomas C. ''State terrorism in Latin America'', p. 158, Rowman & Littlefield, 2007</ref>

The exact chronology of the [[political repression|repression]] is still debated, however, as in some senses the long political war started in 1969. Trade unionists were targeted for assassination by the Peronist and Marxist paramilitary as early as 1969, and individual cases of [[state-sponsored terrorism]] against Peronism and the left can be traced back to the [[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo]] in 1955. The [[Trelew massacre]] of 1972, the actions of the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] since 1973, and [[Isabel Martínez de Perón]]'s "annihilation decrees" against left-wing guerrillas during ''[[Operativo Independencia]]'' (translates to Operation of Independence) in 1975, have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the Dirty War.

Onganía shut down Congress, banned all political parties and dismantled student and worker unions. In 1969, popular discontent led to two massive protests: the ''[[Cordobazo]]'' and the ''[[Rosariazo]]''. The terrorist guerrilla organization [[Montoneros]] kidnapped and executed Aramburu.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=127}} The newly chosen head of government, [[Alejandro Agustín Lanusse]], seeking to ease the growing political pressure, let [[Héctor José Cámpora]] be the Peronist candidate instead of Perón. Cámpora won the [[Argentine general election, March 1973|March 1973 election]], issued a [[amnesty|pardon]] for condemned guerrilla members and then secured Perón's return from his exile in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=423–465}}

On the day Perón returned to Argentina, the clash between Peronist internal factions—[[right-wing]] union leaders and [[left-wing]] youth from Montoneros—resulted in the [[Ezeiza Massacre]]. Cámpora resigned, overwhelmed by political violence, and Perón won the [[Argentine general election, September 1973|September 1973 election]] with his third wife [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel]] as vice-president. He [[expulsion of Montoneros from Plaza de Mayo|expelled Montoneros from the party]]{{sfn|Robben|2011|pp=76–77}} and they became once again a clandestine organization. [[José López Rega]] organized the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] (AAA) to fight against them and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP).
Perón died in July 1974 and was succeeded by his wife, who signed a secret decree empowering the military and the police to "annihilate" the left-wing subversion,{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=145}} [[Operation Independence|stopping ERP's attempt]] to start a rural insurgence in Tucumán province.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=148}} [[March 1976 coup|Isabel Perón was ousted]] one year later by a junta of the three armed forces, led by army general  [[Jorge Rafael Videla]]. They initiated the [[National Reorganization Process]], often shortened to ''Proceso''.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=467–504}}

The ''Proceso'' shut down Congress, removed the judges of the Supreme Court, banned political parties and unions, and resorted to the [[forced disappearance]] of suspected guerrilla members and of anyone believed to be associated with the left-wing. By the end of 1976 Montoneros had lost near 2,000 members; by 1977, the ERP was completely defeated. A severely weakened Montoneros launched a counterattack in 1979, which was quickly annihilated, ending the guerrilla threat. Nevertheless, the junta stayed in power. Then head of state General [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] launched [[Operation Rosario]], which escalated into the [[Falklands War]] ({{lang-es|link=no|Guerra de Malvinas}}); within two months Argentina was defeated by the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Reynaldo Bignone]] replaced Galtieri and began to organize the transition to democratic rule.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=505–532}}

===Contemporary era===
{{main|Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|Kirchnerism}}
[[File:Cristina Fernandez Comandante en Jefe.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], president of Argentina since 2007|alt=]]
[[Raúl Alfonsín]] won the [[Argentine general election, 1983|1983 elections]] campaigning for the prosecution of those responsible for [[human rights]] violations during the ''Proceso'': the [[Trial of the Juntas]] and other martial courts sentenced all the coup's leaders but, under military pressure, he also enacted the [[Full Stop Law|Full Stop]] and [[Law of Due Obedience|Due Obedience]] laws,<ref>{{cite Argentine law|l=23492|date=29 de diciembre de 1986|bo=26058}}</ref><ref>{{cite Argentine law|l=23521|date=9 de junio de 1987|bo=26155}}</ref> which halted prosecutions further down the [[chain of command]]. The worsening economic crisis and [[hyperinflation]] reduced his popular support and the Peronist [[Carlos Menem]] won the [[Argentine general election, 1989|1989 election]]. Soon after, [[1989 riots in Argentina|riots forced Alfonsín to an early resignation]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=533–549}}

Menem embraced [[neo-liberalism|neo-liberal]] policies:{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=6}} a [[Argentine Currency Board|fixed exchange rate]], business [[deregulation]], [[privatization]]s and dismantling of [[protectionism|protectionist]] barriers normalized the economy for a while. He pardoned the officers who had been sentenced during Alfonsín's government. The [[1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution|1994 Constitutional Amendment]] allowed Menem to [[Argentine general election, 1995|be elected for a second term]]. The economy began to decline in 1995, with increasing unemployment and recession;{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=9}} led by [[Fernando de la Rúa]], the UCR returned to the presidency in the [[Argentine general election, 1999|1999 elections]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

De la Rúa kept Menem's economic plan despite the worsening crisis, which led to growing social discontent.{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=9}} A massive [[capital flight]] was responded to with a [[corralito|freezing of bank accounts]], generating further turmoil. The [[December 2001 riots in Argentina|December 2001 riots]] forced him to resign.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=575–587}} Congress appointed [[Eduardo Duhalde]] as acting president, who abrogated the fixed exchange rate established by Menem.{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=12}} By the late 2002 the economic crisis began to recess, but the assassination of two ''[[piquetero]]s'' by the police caused political commotion, prompting Duhalde to move elections forward.{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=13}} [[Néstor Kirchner]] was [[Argentine general election, 2003|elected as the new president]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

Boosting the [[neo-Keynesianism|neo-Keynesian]] economic policies{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=13}} laid by Duhalde, Kirchner ended the economic crisis attaining significant fiscal and trade surpluses, and steep GDP growth.{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=16}} Under his administration Argentina [[Argentine debt restructuring|restructured its defaulted debt]] with an unprecedented discount of about 70% on most bonds, paid off debts with the [[International Monetary Fund]],{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=15}} purged the military of officers with doubtful human rights records,{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=14}} [[void (law)|nullified and voided]] the Full Stop and Due Obedience laws,<ref>{{cite Argentine law|l=25779|date=3 de septiembre de 2003|bo=30226|p=1}}</ref>{{efn-ua|The Full Stop and Due Obedience laws had been abrogated by Congress in 1998.<ref>{{cite Argentine law|l=24952|date=17 de abril de 1998|bo=28879|p=1}}</ref>}} ruled them as unconstitutional, and resumed legal prosecution of the Juntas' crimes.

Climate patterns roughly follow the geographic regional division:{{efn-ua|name=excl_subdiv}}
* The Northwest climate is varied, with rainfall diminishing north to south and east to west:{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=8}} Puna, to the high Andean west, is dry and with great temperature fluctuation but cold overall, frequently falling below freezing point at night;{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=8}} Yungas, to the east, are tropical, very hot and moist.{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=11}}

With heavy seasonal rainfalls,{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=6}} it is subject to periodic droughts.{{sfn|Menutti|Menutti|1980|pp=56–57}}
* Cuyo is generally mild, although mountainous areas have [[alpine climate]] with temperatures below freezing much of the year.{{sfn|Crooker|2009|p=17}}
* Pampas and Sierras Pampeanas are temperate, with hot, stormy summers and cool winters; moisture is higher in the east.{{sfn|Menutti|Menutti|1980|p=69}}
* Patagonia is very windy, with mild summers and cold{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=8}} to very cold winters{{sfn|Crooker|2009|p=25|ps=: "[Sarmiento, the] small town in the [[Chico River Canyon]] of [[Chubut Province]] holds [as of 2009] the record for the lowest temperature in South America, a bone chilling {{convert|-27.22|C|0|abbr=on}}."}} with heavy snowfall and frost,{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=8}} especially in mountainous zones.{{sfn|Menutti|Menutti|1980|p=73}} Precipitation steeply diminishes from west to east.{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=7}}

Major wind currents include the cool [[Pampero Winds]] blowing on the flat plains of Patagonia and the Pampas; following the cold front, warm currents blow from the north in middle and late winter, creating mild conditions.{{sfn|Menutti|Menutti|1980|p=69}}
The [[Sudestada]] usually moderates cold temperatures but brings very heavy rains, rough seas and coastal flooding. It is most common in late autumn and winter along the central coast and in the Río de la Plata estuary.{{sfn|Menutti|Menutti|1980|p=69}}
The [[Zonda wind|Zonda]], a [[foehn wind|hot dry wind]], affects Cuyo and the central Pampas. Squeezed of all moisture during the {{convert|6000|m|0|abbr=on}} descent from the Andes, Zonda winds can blow for hours with gusts up to {{convert|120|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, fueling wildfires and causing damage; between June and November, when the Zonda blows, snowstorms and [[blizzard]] (''viento blanco'') conditions usually affect higher elevations.{{sfn|Menutti|Menutti|1980|p=53}}

Argentina is a [[Federalism|federal]] [[constitutional republic]] and [[representative democracy]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 1}} The government is regulated by a system of [[separation of powers|checks and balances]] defined by the [[Constitution of Argentina]], the country's supreme legal document. The [[seat of government]] is the city of [[Buenos Aires]], as designated by [[Argentine National Congress|Congress]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 3}} Suffrage is [[Universal suffrage|universal]], [[Equal suffrage|equal]], [[Secret ballot|secret]] and [[Compulsory voting|mandatory]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 37}}{{efn-ua|Since 2012 suffrage is optional for ages 16 and 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/11/01/argentina-voting-age/|title=Argentina lowers its voting age to 16|publisher=The Washington Post|place=Washington, D. C.|date=1 November 2012|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no}}</ref>}}

The federal government is composed of three branches:
* [[Legislature|Legislative]]: The [[bicameralism|bicameral]] Congress, made up of the [[Argentine Senate|Senate]] and [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Deputy]] chambers, makes [[federal law]], [[declaration of war|declares war]], approves [[treaty|treaties]] and has the [[power of the purse]] and of [[impeachment]], by which it can remove sitting members of the government.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 53, 59, 75}}
** The Chamber of Deputies represents the people and has 257 voting members elected to a four-year term. Seats are apportioned among the provinces by population every tenth year.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 45, 47, 50}} {{As of|2014}} ten provinces have just five deputies while the [[Buenos Aires Province]], being the most populous one, has 70.
** The Chamber of Senators represents the provinces, has 72 members elected [[at-large]] to six-year terms, with each province having three seats; one third of Senate seats are up for election every other year.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 54, 56}} At least one-third of the candidates presented by the parties must be women.
* [[Executive (government)|Executive]]: The [[President of Argentina|President]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the military, can [[veto]] [[bill (law)|legislative bills]] before they become law—subject to Congressional override—and appoints the [[Cabinet of Argentina|members of the Cabinet]] and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 99}} The President is elected [[direct vote|directly]] by the vote of the people, serves a four-year term and may be elected to office no more than twice in a row.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 90}}
* [[Judiciary|Judicial]]: The [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Supreme Court]] and lower [[Law of Argentina|federal courts]] interpret laws and [[judicial review|overturn those]] they find [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 116}} The Judicial is independent of the Executive and the Legislative. The Supreme Court has seven members appointed by the President—subject to Senate approval—who serve for life. The lower courts' judges are proposed by the [[Council of Magistrates of the Nation|Council of Magistrates]] (a secretariat composed of representatives of judges, lawyers, researchers, the Executive and the Legislative), and appointed by the President on Senate approval.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 99, 114}}

===Provinces===
{{main|Provinces of Argentina}}
{{see also|List of Argentine provinces by population}}
{{Argentina imagemap with province names|float=right|size=300px}}
Argentina is a federation of twenty-three provinces and one [[autonomous city]], Buenos Aires. Provinces are divided for administration purposes into [[Departments of Argentina|departments]] and [[Municipalities of Argentina|municipalities]], except for Buenos Aires Province, which is divided into [[partido]]s. The City of Buenos Aires is divided into [[Barrios and Communes of Buenos Aires|communes]].

Provinces hold all the power that they chose not to delegate to the federal government;{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 121}} they must be representative republics and must not contradict the Constitution.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 5–6}} Beyond this they are fully autonomous: they enact their own constitutions,{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 123}} freely organize their local governments,{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 122}} and own and manage their natural and financial resources.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 124–125}} Some provinces have bicameral legislatures, while others have [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] ones.{{efn-ua|Although not a province, the [[City of Buenos Aires]] is a federally [[autonomous city]], and as such its local organization has similarities with provinces: it has its own constitution, an elected mayor and representatives to the Senate and Deputy chambers.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 129}} As [[federal capital]] of the nation it holds the status of [[federal district]].}}

During the War of Independence the main cities and their surrounding countrysides became provinces though the intervention of their [[cabildo (council)|cabildos]]. The Anarchy of the Year XX completed this process, shaping the original thirteen provinces. Jujuy seceded from [[Salta Province|Salta]] in 1834, and the thirteen provinces became fourteen.
After seceding for a decade, Buenos Aires accepted the 1853 Constitution of Argentina in 1861, and was made a federal territory in 1880.{{sfn|Rey Balmaceda|1995|p=19}}

An 1862 law designated as [[national territory|national territories]] those under federal control but outside the frontiers of the provinces. In 1884 they served as bases for the establishment of the [[governorate]]s of Misiones, Formosa, Chaco, La Pampa, Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego.{{sfn|Rock|1987|p=155}}
The agreement about a frontier dispute with Chile in 1900 created the [[National Territory of Los Andes]]; its lands were incorporated into Jujuy, Salta and [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]] in 1943.{{sfn|Rey Balmaceda|1995|p=19}} [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]] and Chaco became provinces in 1951. Misiones did so in 1953, and [[Formosa Province|Formosa]], [[Neuquén Province|Neuquén]], [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]], [[Chubut Province|Chubut]] and Santa Cruz, in 1955. The last national territory, Tierra del Fuego, became the Tierra del Fuego, Antártida e Islas del Atlántico Sur Province in 1990.{{sfn|Rey Balmaceda|1995|p=19}}

===Science and technology===
{{Main|Science and technology in Argentina}}
[[File:Aquarius SAC-D Launch.jpg|thumb|Argentine [[satellite]] [[SAC-D]], launched in 2011.]]
Argentines have three Nobel Prize laureates in the Sciences. [[Bernardo Houssay]], the first Latin American among them, discovered the role of [[pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] in regulating [[glucose]] in animals. [[César Milstein]] did extensive research in [[antibody|antibodies]]. [[Luis Leloir]] discovered how organisms store energy converting glucose into [[glycogen]] and the compounds which are fundamental in [[metabolism|metabolizing]] [[carbohydrate]]s. Argentine research has led to the treatment of [[heart disease]]s and several forms of cancer. [[Domingo Liotta]] designed and developed the first [[artificial heart]] successfully implanted in a human being in 1969. [[René Favaloro]] developed the techniques and performed the world's first ever coronary [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]].

Argentina's nuclear programme has been highly successful. In 1957 Argentina was the first country in Latin America to design and build a [[research reactor]] with homegrown technology, the [[RA-1 Enrico Fermi]]. This reliance in the development of own nuclear related technologies, instead of simply buying them abroad, was a constant of Argentina's nuclear programme conducted by the civilian [[National Atomic Energy Commission]] (CNEA). Nuclear facilities with Argentine technology have been built in Peru, Algeria, Australia and Egypt. In 1983, the country admitted having the capability of producing weapon-grade [[uranium]], a major step needed to assemble [[nuclear weapon]]s; since then, however, Argentina has pledged to use nuclear power only for peaceful purposes.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://carnegieendowment.org/2009/01/08/brazil-and-argentina-s-nuclear-cooperation/3jqa|title= Brazil and Argentina's Nuclear Cooperation|author= Argüello, Irma |date= 8 January 2009|publisher= Carnegie Endowment for international peace}}</ref> As a member of the Board of Governors of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], Argentina has been a strong voice in support of nuclear non-proliferation efforts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26516.htm |title=Background Note: Argentina |publisher=State.gov}}</ref> and is highly committed to global nuclear security.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/04/140130.htm |title=Hillary Clinton: Argentina is on the forefront of the fight for nuclear security |publisher=State.gov |date=13 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref> In 1974 it was the first country in Latin America to put in-line a commercial nuclear power plant, [[Atucha I Nuclear Power Plant|Atucha I]].

Despite its modest budget and numerous setbacks, academics and the sciences in Argentina have enjoyed an international respect since the turn of the 1900s, when Dr. [[Luis Agote]] devised the first safe and effective means of [[blood transfusion]] as well as [[René Favaloro]], who was a pioneer in the improvement of the [[coronary artery bypass surgery]]. Argentine scientists are still on the cutting edge in fields such as [[nanotechnology]], [[physics]], [[computer science]]s, molecular biology, oncology, ecology, and cardiology.

During the 18th and 19th centuries especially, Argentina was the country with the second biggest immigration wave in the world, with 6.6 million, second only to the [[USA]] in the numbers of immigrants received (27 millions) and ahead of such other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia.<ref name="ref1">https://web.archive.org/web/20070610215422/http://www.cels.org.ar/Site_cels/publicaciones/informes_pdf/1998.Capitulo7.pdf</ref><ref name="ref2">https://web.archive.org/web/20110814202421/http://docentes.fe.unl.pt/~satpeg/PapersInova/Labor%20and%20Immigration%20in%20LA-2005.pdf</ref>

Strikingly, at those times, the national population doubled every two decades.

{{main|Culture of Argentina}}
{{see also|List of Argentines}}
Argentina is a [[multiculturalism|multicultural country]] with significant European influences. Its cities are largely characterized by both the prevalence of people of European descent, and of conscious imitation of European styles in fashion, architecture and design.{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=91}} The other big influence is the [[gaucho]]s and their traditional country lifestyle of self-reliance.{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=123}} Finally, indigenous American traditions have been absorbed into the general cultural milieu.

Although Argentina's rich literary history began around 1550,{{sfn|Rivas|1989|p=11}} it reached full independence with [[Esteban Echeverría]]'s ''[[El Matadero]]'', a [[Romantic literature|romantic]] landmark that played a significant role in the development of 19th century's Argentine narrative,{{sfn|Foster|Lockhart|Lockhart|1998|p=99}} split by the ideological divide between the popular, federalist epic of [[José Hernández (writer)|José Hernández]]' ''[[Martín Fierro]]'' and the elitist and cultured discourse of [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Sarmiento]]'s masterpiece, ''[[Facundo]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Foster|1a2=Lockhart|1a3=Lockhart|1y=1998|1pp=13, 101|2a1=Young|2a2=Cisneros|2y=2010|2p=51}}

The [[Modernist literature|Modernist]] movement advanced into the 20th century including exponents such as [[Leopoldo Lugones]] and poet [[Alfonsina Storni]];{{sfn|Young|Cisneros|2010|pp=51–52}} it was followed by [[Vanguardism]], with [[Ricardo Güiraldes]]'s ''[[Don Segundo Sombra]]'' as an important reference.{{sfnm|1a1=Foster|1a2=Lockhart|1a3=Lockhart|1y=1998|1pp=104, 107–109|2a1=Young|2a2=Cisneros|2y=2010|2p=223}}

[[Jorge Luis Borges]], Argentina's most acclaimed writer and one of the foremost figures in the [[history of literature]],{{sfn|Bloom|1994|p=2}} found new ways of looking at the modern world in [[metaphor]] and philosophical debate and his influence has extended to authors all over the globe. Short stories such as ''[[Ficciones]]'' and ''[[The Aleph (short story collection)|The Aleph]]'' are among his most famous books. He was a friend and collaborator with [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]], who wrote one of the most praised [[science fiction]] [[novel]]s, ''[[The Invention of Morel]]''.{{sfn|Young|Cisneros|2010|pp=52, 80}}
[[Julio Cortázar]], one of the leading members of the [[Latin American Boom]] and a major name in 20th century literature,{{sfn|Young|Cisneros|2010|pp=79, 144}} influenced an entire generation of writers in the Americas and Europe.{{sfn|Young|Cisneros|2010|pp=3, 144}}

Other highly regarded Argentine writers, poets and [[essay]]ists include [[Estanislao del Campo]], [[Eugenio Cambaceres]], [[Pedro Bonifacio Palacios]], [[Hugo Wast]], [[Benito Lynch]], [[Enrique Banchs]], [[Oliverio Girondo]], [[Ezequiel Martínez Estrada]], [[Victoria Ocampo]], [[Leopoldo Marechal]], [[Silvina Ocampo]], [[Roberto Arlt]], [[Eduardo Mallea]], [[Manuel Mujica Láinez]], [[Ernesto Sábato]], [[Silvina Bullrich]], [[Rodolfo Walsh]], [[María Elena Walsh]], [[Tomás Eloy Martínez]], [[Manuel Puig]], [[Alejandra Pizarnik]], and [[Osvaldo Soriano]].{{sfnm|1a1=Foster|1a2=Lockhart|1a3=Lockhart|1y=1998|1pp=66, 85, 97–121||2a1=McCloskey|2a2=Burford|2y=2006|3p=43|3a1=Díaz|3y=2010|3pp=22, 91|4a1=Young|4a2=Cisneros|4y=2010|4pp=51–54}}

[[Tango]], a ''[[Río de la Plata|Rioplatense]]'' musical genre with European and African influences,{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=86}} is one of Argentina's international cultural symbols.{{sfn|Foster|Lockhart|Lockhart|1998|p=121}}
The golden age of tango (1930 to mid-1950s) mirrored that of [[jazz]] and [[swing music|swing]] in the United States, featuring large orchestras like those of [[Osvaldo Pugliese]], [[Aníbal Troilo]], [[Francisco Canaro]], [[Julio de Caro]] and [[Juan d'Arienzo]].{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=43}}
After 1955, virtuoso [[Ástor Piazzolla]] popularized ''[[Nuevo tango]]'', a subtler and more intellectual trend for the genre.{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=43}}
Tango enjoys worldwide popularity nowadays with groups like [[Gotan Project]], [[Bajofondo]] and [[Tanghetto]].

Argentina developed strong classical music and dance scenes that gave rise to renowned artists such as [[Alberto Ginastera]], composer; [[Alberto Lysy]], violinist; [[Martha Argerich]] and [[Eduardo Delgado]], pianists; [[Daniel Barenboim]], pianist and [[symphonic orchestra]] director; [[José Cura]] and [[Marcelo Álvarez]], tenors; and to [[ballet dancer]]s [[Jorge Donn]], [[José Neglia]], [[Norma Fontenla]], [[Maximiliano Guerra]], [[Paloma Herrera]], [[Marianela Núñez]], [[Iñaki Urlezaga]] and [[Julio Bocca]].{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=43}}

A national Argentine folk style emerged in the 1930s from dozens of regional musical genres and went to influence the entirety of [[Latin American music]]. Some of its interpreters, like [[Atahualpa Yupanqui]] and [[Mercedes Sosa]], achieved worldwide acclaim.

The [[romantic ballad]] genre included singers of international fame such as [[Sandro de América]].

[[Argentine rock]] developed as a distinct musical style in the mid-1960s, when Buenos Aires and Rosario became cradles of aspiring musicians.
Founding bands like [[Los Gatos]], [[Sui Generis]], [[Almendra (band)|Almendra]] and [[Manal]] were followed by [[Seru Giran]], [[Los Abuelos de la Nada]], [[Soda Stereo]] and [[Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota]], with prominent artists including [[Litto Nebbia]], [[Andrés Calamaro]], [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]], [[Charly García]], [[Fito Paez]] and [[León Gieco]].{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=43}}

[[Tenor saxophone|Tenor saxophonist]] [[Gato Barbieri|Leandro "Gato" Barbieri]] and composer and [[big band]] conductor [[Lalo Schifrin]] are among the most internationally successful Argentine jazz musicians.

Numerous Argentine architects have enriched their own country's cityscape and those around the world: [[Juan Antonio Buschiazzo]] helped popularize [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] and [[Francisco Gianotti]] combined [[Art Nouveau]] with [[Italianate]] styles, each adding flair to Argentine cities during the early 20th century. [[Francisco Salamone]] and [[Viktor Sulčič]] left an [[Art Deco]] legacy, and [[Alejandro Bustillo]] created a prolific body of [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[Rationalist architecture]]. [[Alberto Prebisch]] and [[Amancio Williams]] were highly influenced by [[Le Corbusier]], while [[Clorindo Testa]] introduced [[Brutalist architecture]] locally. [[César Pelli]]'s and [[Patricio Pouchulu]]'s [[Futurist architecture|Futurist]] creations have graced cities worldwide: Pelli's 1980s throwbacks to the Art Deco glory of the 1920s made him one of the world's most prestigious architects, with the [[Norwest Center]] and the [[Petronas Towers]] among his most celebrated creations.
